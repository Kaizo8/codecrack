You're handed an array of  n  positive integers  a1, a2, . . ., an . 

You're allowed to perform at most  2n  operations, each of which involves selecting any subset of the array and adding 1 to each selected element.

Your task is to modify the array such that for each  i = 1, 2, . . ., n-1 ,  a{i+1}  is not divisible by  ai . 

There's no need to minimize the number of operations.

Input:
-  t  (where  1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 ): number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  -  n  (where  1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 ): length of the given array.
  -  n  integers  a1, a2, . . ., an  (where  1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9 ): the given array.

Output:
- For each test case, print the modified array  a  on a separate line.
- Print  n  integers representing the resulting array after applying the operations.
