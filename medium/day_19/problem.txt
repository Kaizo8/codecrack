You're presented with two arrays of integers, a1, a2, . . ., an and b1, b2, . . ., bn. Before any operations, you have the freedom to rearrange the elements in each array as you see fit. Then, in a single operation, you can choose an element from array a and remove it, and simultaneously choose an element from array b and remove it.

Your objective is to minimize the number of operations required to ensure that ai < bi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, where k is the final size of both arrays after operations.

But wait, the problem just got upgraded! Now, you're given an additional positive integer m. In this enhanced challenge, you need to compute the sum of the answers to the problem for m pairs of arrays (c[i], b), where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Array c[i] is derived from a as follows:
- c[i]1 = i,
- c[i]j = aj for 2 ≤ j ≤ n.

Input:
- t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4): number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - n and m (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and m = 1): size of arrays a and b, and constraints on the value of element a1.
  - n - 1 integers representing elements a2, . . ., an (where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
  - n integers representing elements b1, b2, . . ., bn (where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9).

Output:
- For each test case, output the total number of minimum operations required for all pairs of arrays (c[i], b).
